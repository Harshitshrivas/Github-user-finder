## 💡 What I Learned & Built

This project is part of my learning journey in **JavaScript**, where I practiced:

- Making requests to the **GitHub API** to fetch user data  
- Handling **asynchronous operations** using `async/await`  
- Using **error handling** for invalid users or network issues  
- Dynamically updating the **DOM** with user profile info  
- Displaying user avatar, name, username, ID, bio, followers, repos, etc.

It was a hands-on way to solidify my understanding of API integration and JavaScript in web development.
